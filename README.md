# [Languages & Compilers](https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?content=courses_catalog&openmenu=demoAcc3&lang=en&course=22)  

Created a compiler for Alpha programming language from scratch in C++.  

The stages of the compiler I did with my teammates are:  
- Lexical analysis  
- Syntax analysis  
- Intermediate code generator  
- Final Code generator
